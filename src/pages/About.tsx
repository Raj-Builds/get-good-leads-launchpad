              <p>
                We started with a simple observation: most businesses don't have a traffic problem—they
                have a conversion, funnel, and follow-up problem. Spend more, and you simply buy more of
                the same disappointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                So we work in the other direction. First the offer, then the landing page, then the
                tracking, and only then the media spend. It's disciplined in week one and dramatically cheaper
                by month three.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today we partner with a deliberately focused roster of brands across home services,
                healthcare, education, real estate, and B2B—the categories where one good lead can
                transform a quarter.
